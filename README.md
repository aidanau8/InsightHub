## 📘 Week 1 — Foundation & Project Setup

### 🎯 Main Objective  
Set up the full Java development environment, generate a Spring Boot project, and successfully run the first endpoint locally and push it to GitHub via SSH.

### ⚙️ Tasks Completed
✅ Installed and configured **JDK 17** and verified environment variables  
✅ Installed **IntelliJ IDEA** and connected it with **Maven**  
✅ Generated a **Spring Boot 3 project** via [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) with dependencies:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Spring Web  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Thymeleaf  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Spring Data JPA  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• H2 Database  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Lombok  
✅ Created a **HelloController** with a `/hello` endpoint returning `"Hello from InsightHub 🚀"`  
✅ Successfully ran the project on `http://localhost:8080/hello`  
✅ Installed **Git** and initialized a local repository  
✅ Set up **SSH authentication** with GitHub  
✅ Uploaded the entire project to a **public GitHub repository**  
✅ Verified Lombok and annotation processing

### 🧠 What I Learned
💡 How to set up a complete Java + Maven + IntelliJ environment  
💡 Understanding **Spring Boot** structure (controllers, dependencies, build lifecycle)  
💡 Basics of **REST API** and `@RestController`  
💡 Using **Spring Initializr** for fast project generation  
💡 Setting up **SSH connection** with GitHub and clean commit management

### 🧩 Key Deliverable
✅ A fully functional **Spring Boot 3.5.7** application with a working `/hello` endpoint.  
✅ Repository connected via SSH and pushed to GitHub.

🖥️ Example output:
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
